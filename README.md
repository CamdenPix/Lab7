# Lab 7 - Student Information System (SIS)
Group 1's Lab 7 implementation for Object Oriented. SIS is an application to manage assigning students, instructors, and TAs to courses.

## Description
**Created by:** Sam, Kene, Luke, Camden.

**Name of Database:** SRSDB.bak

**How to find and run the Database:** When SRSDB.bak has been downloaded, go to it's properties, and unblock it. In MS SSMS, restore the database and establish a connection. In Visual Studio (.NET Framework) connect to the database that was restored in MS SSMS, then build and run this project. We have already created all the models, controllers, and views that are needed to run the web page.

**Modifications:** Changed the color of the navigation bar. We also updated the "about" and "contact" tabs and enhanced the descriptions and layout of the home page.
